* Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you discover bugs or issues, or have ideas for
improvements or new features, please file a report on the issue tracker for this
repository. Follow the guidelines below to make sure everything goes smoothly.

** Issue reporting
- Check that the issue has not already been reported
- Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
- Open an issue with a clear title
- Write as grammatically correct as you can in the description.

** Pull requests
- Perform all changes on a topic branch for easier merging
- Follow the coding conventions already in use
- Verify Emacs Lisp code with =checkdoc=
- Add unit tests whenever possible
- Open a [[https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests][pull request]] relating to a single issue.

** Coding Conventions

*** Naming
Add a prefix for all internal names.

Use a namespace prefix followed by two dashes for internal names, e.g.
  =__PROJECT-NAME__--internal-function=.

*** Docstrings
Write meaningful docstrings for all functions and vars.
- Document all functions and variables as directed by =checkdoc=.
- Consider using [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] to automate =checkdoc= while you're editing.

*** Common Lisp functions
Use =cl-lib= instead of =cl=. The =cl= library pollutes the global namespace and
its usage is therefore discouraged.
- Use =cl-lib=, which adds prefixes to all cl function names
- Use =[[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-noflet][noflet]]= instead of =flet= when you need to dynamically rebind functions.
